    <h2>About Jackson Latimore</h2>
    <p>Jackson Latimore, founder of Latimore Life & Legacy LLC, is a first‑generation Pennsylvanian who understands the financial realities faced by families in post‑industrial communities. Growing up in Schuylkill County, Jackson witnessed how illness, layoffs and unexpected losses could derail a family's future.</p>
    <p>Driven by a mission to break those generational cycles of financial vulnerability, Jackson became an independent insurance broker. He specializes in life insurance, annuities and legacy planning to help families build wealth and security. His approach is grounded in transparency, education and long‑term relationships — not sales quotas.</p>
    <p>Jackson holds Pennsylvania Department of Insurance License #1268820 and NIPR #21638507. He partners with reputable carriers to deliver customized solutions that fit your goals.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, Jackson is active in local community initiatives, mentors young entrepreneurs and enjoys exploring the mountains and trails of central Pennsylvania with his family.</p>
